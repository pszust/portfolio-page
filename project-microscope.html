                    <p>
                        This sophisticated microscope system integrates cutting-edge features, including advanced light
                        polarization capabilities with two independently rotatable linear polarizers driven by precise
                        piezo motors. It also incorporates a laser projection system capable of projecting arbitrary
                        light patterns onto the sample surface, a heating stage, and a motorized XY stage. Originally
                        designed and constructed by us for studying thin-film liquid-crystalline samples, this versatile
                        system facilitates precise and controllable laser illumination tasks for a wide range of sample
                        types.

                        A pivotal aspect of this system lies in its software component. To accomplish main objective of
                        altering the handedness of chiral liquid crystal phases by guiding phase transition changes
                        using laser illumination, I created a specific algorithm. Implemented in Python, the algorithm
                        autonomously identifies chiral domains through the utilization of openCV, providing an automated
                        and efficient solution to guide laser illumination with unprecedented accuracy and
                        effectiveness.

                    <p>
                        This equipment demands a sophisticated control program, which i created using Python with the
                        aid tkinter library. This program empowers users with complete command over the myriad functions
                        of the microscope, enabling the seamless execution of automated tasks involving multiple steps,
                        even for those without programming expertise. The accompanying image showcases the graphical
                        user interface (GUI) of the program, providing users with an intuitive visual interface, while a
                        video captures the entire system executing a complex automated task.
